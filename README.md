# 🔥 HUNTER TREASURY

⚔ Combat Treasury Simulation Engine  
A battle-style CLI treasury management system built with Node.js.

Hunter Treasury is a command-line treasury engine designed to simulate
resource forging, allocation, draining, and live balance tracking
in an aggressive combat-style interface.

---

## ⚔ Core Concept

Hunter Treasury transforms traditional balance tracking into a
combat-driven treasury simulation.

Instead of basic output logs, this engine presents:

- Structured battle panels
- Vault forging mechanics
- Resource capture system
- Drain validation checks
- Error combat alerts
- Clean shutdown sequence

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚔ Forge initial treasury vault
- 💰 Allocate additional resources
- 🔻 Drain treasury with validation protection
- 📊 Live structured balance table
- ⚠ Insufficient balance detection
- 🧨 Error-safe command handling
- 🎮 Combat-styled CLI interface
- 🧱 Lightweight & fast execution

---

## 🖥 Command List

| Command   | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| forge     | Create initial treasury vault |
| allocate  | Add funds to treasury |
| drain     | Subtract funds (with validation) |
| status    | Show structured treasury table |
| exit      | Shutdown engine |

---

## ⚔ Interface Preview

Hunter Treasury uses a structured ASCII combat panel:

┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ VAULT FORGED                 │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ Balance : 1000               │
└──────────────────────────────┘

Designed for impact, clarity, and command control.
