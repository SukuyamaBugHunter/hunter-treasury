# 🧠 SKILL – HUNTER TREASURY

## 🔥 Core Technical Skills Demonstrated

Hunter Treasury showcases advanced CLI system design and state-driven execution logic.

---

## ⚔ CLI Architecture

- Node.js readline interface
- Interactive command loop
- Dynamic input handling
- Clean shutdown control
- Real-time state updates

---

## 📊 State Management

- Persistent in-memory treasury variable
- Controlled state mutation
- Balance validation before subtraction
- Conditional logic for error handling
- Structured output rendering

---

## 🛡 Validation & Protection Logic

- Numeric parsing with fallback handling
- Over-drain protection
- Error detection and controlled feedback
- Safe execution flow

---

## 🎨 Console UI Engineering

- ANSI color control codes
- Dynamic ASCII table rendering
- Structured balance panels
- Combat-style interface presentation
- Clean formatted spacing

---

## ⚙ Functional Components

- forge() → Initialize treasury state
- allocate() → Increase treasury value
- drain() → Decrease with validation
- status() → Display structured panel
- exit() → Graceful shutdown

---

## 🧩 Software Design Principles
